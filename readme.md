## Description
Meriks's modified version of the original [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll), hopefully delivering a faster, and better-practiced library for process memory manipulation.

The key changes and features of this fork include:

* Improved code performance
* Expansion of detour options, such as 5-byte jmp near, 14-byte jmp far, and 16-byte call far
* Programmed in .NET 7
* Actually I dont know, just explore it or something

## Platform Support
* For legacy Windows operating systems, check out [memory_legacy.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory_legacy.dll).
* For MacOS operating systems, check out [memory.dylib](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dylib).
* For 32-bit operating systems, consider the original [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll).
